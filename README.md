## Auth Management System

With PlusClouds' auth management system, the token stored securely on the user's device is verified against the system's token upon login. If the token is valid, the user can continue performing in-app transactions securely. In the event of token invalidation, a new token is issued to the user for verification, and once verified, a new token is assigned.
